# FakeCryptoMiner

This was a super random project that was only created 
due to a random boost of motivation at like, midnight.

Yes, I know this is some terribly digusting and badly written code.
This was just for fun, so don't criticize the monstrosity of terribly written code I have created

This is pretty much just to "impress" tech noobies or dummies idk
This project was pretty cringy ngl asldjfasldjfa;sldjfasldjfl

Again, idk how the whole licensing thing works, but you are free to copy, distribute, edit, modify, do whatever you want with my code
Not that anbody would ever touch my code that is... lol

I should go to bed now. it's like, 2:05 AM rn on a Sunday morning and I have church ;-;
